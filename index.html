<h1>Why do u love her this much?</h1>
<body>
    <p>I have been her friend for some time but recently we
        got too close and i ended up falling in love with her.<br>
    possibly this could be the reasons why i love her;<br>
<ul><il><em>-she is kind and i love that</em></il></ul>
<ul><il><em>-she is funny in some way</em></il></ul>
<ul><il><em>-she is caring</em></il></ul>
<ul><il><em>-i love her sweet voice</em></il></ul>
<ul><il><em>-she is special in some way and thats why i always want<br>
to talk to her like there is a way we are connected when talking to eachother.  </em></il></ul>
